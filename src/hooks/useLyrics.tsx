[Verse 1]
In the silence of the night
When the world fades from sight
I hear echoes of your voice
Calling out, I have no choice

[Chorus]
Nothing can replace
The memories we made
Every word you said
Still echoes in my head
Nothing can replace
The love that cannot fade

[Verse 2]
Time may heal the deepest scars
But you're written in the stars
Every sunset, every dawn
Reminds me you're not gone

[Chorus]
Nothing can replace
The memories we made
Every word you said
Still echoes in my head
Nothing can replace
The love that cannot fade

[Bridge]
Though you're gone, I carry on
With the strength that you gave me
In my heart, you'll never part
You're my greatest legacy

[Final Chorus]
Nothing can replace
The memories we made
Every word you said
Still echoes in my head
Nothing can replace
The love that cannot fade
